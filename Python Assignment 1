1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed
in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

l=list(range(2000,3201))
l1=[]
for i in l:
    if (i%7 == 0) and (i%5 != 0):
        l1.append(i)
print(l1)


2. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.
